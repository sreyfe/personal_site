Hi -- I am a PhD student in Comparative Literature at Harvard. My main interests are Yiddish Studies, Digital Humanities, Translation Studies, and the intersections of these fields. My current primary Digital Humanities project is [iberz](https://iberz.org/), a database of translations into Yiddish. I have a BA in Comparative Literature, German, and Jewish Studies from the University of Chicago, as well as a MA in Allgemeine und Vergleichende Literaturwissenschaft (General and Comparative Literary Studies) from the Freie Universit√§t Berlin. I have previously worked as a Yiddish Fellow at the Forverts and Editorial Intern at *In geveb*, and was recently a Translation Fellow at the Yiddish Book Center. I have also worked as a DH research assistant for the FU Berlin's Temporal Communities project. You can reach me at jonah0lubin [at] gmail.com.
