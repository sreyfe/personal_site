Hi -- I am a freelance translator, writer, and researcher living in Berlin. I am particularly interested in Yiddish, translation, and digital humanities. I have a BA in Comparative Literature, German, and Jewish Studies from the University of Chicago, and am currently working on an MA in General and Comparative Literary Studies at the Freie Universit√§t Berlin. I have previously worked as a Yiddish Fellow at the Forverts and Editorial Intern at *In geveb*, and was recently a Translation Fellow at the Yiddish Book Center. I am currently a DH research assistant for the FU Berlin's Temporal Communities project. You can reach me at jonah0lubin [at] gmail.com. Github: [https://github.com/sreyfe](https://github.com/sreyfe).
