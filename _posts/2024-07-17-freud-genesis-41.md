A while back a friend gave me a very nice hardcover Suhrkamp of Freud's *Mann Moses*, pictured below:

The volume (published in English as *Moses and Monotheism*) contains three essays published in the last
years of Freud's life. He began to prepare the last of the three essays in Vienna, but only managed
to publish it after fleeing to England following the German invasion of Austria.

In case you aren't familiar, this is Freud's claim in a nutshell: Moses was never 
a Jew at all, but a high-ranking Egyptian who was loyal to the monotheistic cult which 
worshipped the sun god Aten, which was briefly the state religion of Egypt under 
Akhenaten. After Akhenaten's death and the official reestablishment of polytheism, Moses 
decided to leave Egypt. He brought with him a Semitic tribe
(read: the forefathers of the Jews), upon whom he more-or-less forced his religion.
At some point in the desert, the proto-Jews rebelled and killed Moses. They then met up 
with related tribes and formed some sort of confederation. The Moses-religion was disavowed
but survived among the Levites, whom Freud claims were the clique of Egyptians that Moses brought 
along with him. At some point a couple of generations later, the proto-Jews take up the worship 
of a Midianite volcano-god named \[ʀᴇᴅᴀᴄᴛᴇᴅ\], under the direction of an unnamed
prophet. But the Moses-followers had grown in number and influence during the 
intervening generations, and so a compromise was made between them and the followers 
of the volcano-god. The new prophet was identified was Moses, and the attributes of
\[ʀᴇᴅᴀᴄᴛᴇᴅ\] and Aten were melted together. The murder of Moses then has all manner 
of psychoanalytic effects, sets the scene for Christianity, etc.

Freud himself repeatedly admits that the historical evidence for all this is 
rather sparse, but it seems he more-or-less believes it to be true. It's a bit 
of a crackpot theory, but its very entertaining to read and good food for 
thought. Reading these essays feels a little like reading (forgive the comparison)
Däniken: you can't really believe these fantastic claims about the
secret origins of the world we live in, but you're glad to be along for the ride, and 
maybe there's a little bit of truth in there somewhere...

For textual support, Freud resorts to the work of Ed. Sellin, and *Mose und seine Bedeutung 
für die israelitisch-jüdische Religionsgeschichte* (1922) in particular. I haven't read
the article, but apparently, there is evidence in *Hosea* and elsewhere that Moses 
was killed by the Israelites during one of their many (biblically documented) uprisings.
Here is Freud on Sellin:

>Er fand beim Propheten Hosea (zweite Hälfte des achten Jahrhunderts) die unverkennbaren Anzeichen einer Tradition, die zum Inhalt hat, daß der Religionsstifter Moses in einem Aufstand seines widerspenstigen und halsstarrigen Volkes ein gewaltsames Ende fand. Gleichzeitig wurde die von ihm eingesetzte Religion abgeworfen. Diese Tradition ist aber nicht auf Hosea beschränkt, sie kehrt bei den meisten späteren Propheten wieder, ja, sie ist nach Sellin die Grundlage aller späteren messianischen Erwartungen geworden. Am Ausgang des babylonischen Exils entwickelte sich im jüdischen Volke die Hoffnung, der so schmählich Gemordete werde von den Toten wiederkommen und sein reuiges Volk, vielleicht dieses nicht allein, in das Reich einer dauernden Seligkeit führen. Die naheliegenden Beziehungen zum Schicksal eines späteren Religionsstifters liegen nicht auf unserem Weg.

Now, like I said, I don't believe in this stuff, but nonetheless I think I've found 
a nice piece of evidence for it which Freud doesn't mention. Last night I thought that 
it might be fun to read a random chapter of Genesis every day, and so today I put
the range 1-50 in a random number generator, got 41 as output, and sat down to 
read Genesis 41. This is the chapter where Joseph interprets Pharaoh's dreams:
the scrawny cows eating the healthy cows, and the scrawny grain eating the healthy 
grain, both of which are so excellently illustrated by R. Crumb (below).

As part of his reward for successfully interpreting Pharaoh's dreams, in verse 45 
Joseph is married to Asenath, daughter of Poti-phera, *priest of On*. [^1]
On (aka Heliopolis) is mentioned repeatedly by Freud as the place of origin of 
the monotheistic worship of Aten which the Egyptian Moses practiced
and semi-successfully transmitted to his chosen Semitic tribe.

That the leader of the people Israel preceding Moses was the son-in-law of a priest of the 
sun-god seems like a perfect piece of evidence for Freud. The lineage of Jewish leadership
dovetails with the lineage of Egyptian Aten priests! When coupled with 
the Traumdeutung which plays such a significant role in this chapter, it's 
very strange that Freud left this out. I wonder if he knew of this chapter 
and, if so, what he thought of it...
